    ANSWERED QUESTIONS
reLu need before cross entropy?
NO: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/166595/how-to-apply-cross-entropy-on-rectified-linear-units

should 'target' in __genData__ be a number??
    Yes: Copied from torch code:
    See __getItem__: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torchvision/datasets/fakedata.html

Generate images in init or while looping?
    Moved ot init. Index from python list.
    I think new data was being generated on each getItem, providing unlimited training data


Should output for generated data be a 2d image or 3D image with 1 channel
    1xWxH seems to be working

How to plot multiple outputs on TensorFlow?
    save all logs in same higher lever folder and open browser

    QUESTIONS
should the fc layers in toy examples have bias?

initialization of param vals: pytorch does not have truncated normal. Using regular normal initialization 
    and setting large values to some constant

does W have to be normalized?


    OPTIMIZATIONS
k binning optimization in paper
dtype 64 -> 32 -> 16
new tensor on each addition
applyFilter takes OT as arg and adjusts entries instead of returning


TODO:
    look in paper on how 
        to normalize input (per batch or per channel)
        optomize forward pass
    
    Initialize weights: truncate normal
    
    train small FC/conv network on toy data and make plot
    
    look into training network on university server
    
    make CoL NN module
